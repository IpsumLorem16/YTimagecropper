# YouTube Thumbnail Cropper

<img src="images/screenshot.jpg" width="700">

A custom internal tool for scraping Youtube video thumbnails and putting them into a cropper.  Cropping down to exact dimension needed, and allows user to set quality.

This was created to solve a problem, needing to quickly grab a Youtubers thumbnails, and manually crop them to preserve text or stop chopping faces in half. 


You can try it out on github page, it will automatically load some thumbnails, and crops images to 800x600 px. You can add any other video thumbnail using the input on the cropper tool. 
The upload button adds all 'saved images' to the file-input on within wp, and uploads them automatically.

It is not perfect. This tool was primarily designed to be embedded in the WordPress “Add Post” page. It is responsive enough for general use but was not optimized for small screens.
